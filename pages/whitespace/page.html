	<div class="desc">Here we can see the visualization of whitespace in our document. Word visualizes spaces as dots, new lines as pilcrows, and indentation as arrows.<br><br>As we can see on the third line, there is no arrow indicating the indentation. This because that line was not indented using the tab key, but instead using the preferred method of ruler indentation.</div>

	<div class="desc">Another type of useful whitespace is the page break, which can be inserted by holding the control key and pressing enter. A page break makes sure that everything coming after it start on a new page. This is useful in many occasions. At the end of a chapter for example.</div>
